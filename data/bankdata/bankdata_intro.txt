任务

You are provided with a dataset which is related to direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a banking institution. 

The business problem is to predict whether the client will subscribe to a term deposit. 

Participants are expected to undertake a thorough analysis of the dataset and build a prediction model to solve this business problem.  

Business suggestions are welcomed but not mandatory.  

Participants will be required to submit analysis along with modelling/algorithm design and validation for judging.  

The judging panel will assess entries in accordance with the competition requirements and select up to 10 finalists who will progress to complete a presentation.  

Finalists will be invited to ANZ Chengdu Office (or dial in) to present their entry in English. The presentation gives you the opportunity to further explain how your entry addresses the business problem.

The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.

You will need to download the dataset with all examples and 20 inputs, ordered by date (from May 2008 to November 2010).

The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) a term deposit (variable y). 

Attribute Information:

a)Input variables:
# bank client data:
1. age (numeric)
2. job : type of job (categorical: 'admin.','blue-collar','entrepreneur','housemaid','management','retired','self-employed','services','student','technician','unemployed','unknown')
3. marital : marital status (categorical: 'divorced','married','single','unknown'; note: 'divorced' means divorced or widowed)
4. education (categorical: 'basic.4y','basic.6y','basic.9y','high.school','illiterate','professional.course','university.degree','unknown')
5. default: has credit in default? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')
6. housing: has home loan? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')
7. loan: has personal loan? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')
# related with the last contact of the current campaign:
8. contact: contact communication type (categorical: 'cellular','telephone') 
9. month: last contact month of year (categorical: 'jan', 'feb', 'mar', ..., 'nov', 'dec')
10. day_of_week: last contact day of the week (categorical: 'mon','tue','wed','thu','fri')
11. duration: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric). Important note: this attribute highly affects the output target (e.g., if duration=0 then y='no'). Yet, the duration is not known before a call is performed. Also, after the end of the call y is obviously known. Thus, this input should only be included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive model.
# other attributes:
12. campaign: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact)
13. pdays: number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric; 999 means client was not previously contacted)
14. previous: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client (numeric)
15. poutcome: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: 'failure','nonexistent','success')
# social and economic context attributes：
16. emp.var.rate: employment variation rate. quarterly indicator (numeric)
17. cons.price.idx: consumer price index. monthly indicator (numeric) 
18. cons.conf.idx: consumer confidence index. monthly indicator (numeric) 
19. euribor3m: euribor 3 month rate. daily indicator (numeric)
20. nr.employed: number of employees. quarterly indicator (numeric)

b)Output variable (desired target):
21. y - has the client subscribed a term deposit? (binary: 'yes','no')
